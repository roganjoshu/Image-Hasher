The Image De-Duplicator is a tool for locating duplicate images through the implementation of a difference-hash (Krawetz, 2013). The software implements a modified binary search to identify a group of duplicate items in a sorted list of custom Image types. Users are also able to delete images, delete all duplicate images, or move the duplicate images to C:\\Duplicate Images with the click of a button. Additional information pertaining to the images is also displayed, some EXIF data is unavailable however.
